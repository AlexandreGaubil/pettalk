note on how to create rectangles in swift


BUGS:
when keyboard is dismissed and called again, the view does not slide up as it should


Detect when a question is asked (when there is a '?' in string)


is ping-pong, tennis, badminton a collective or alone sport?
add story to movies and books

//IF string is subset of string
if string.lowercased().range(of:"swift") != nil {
print("exists")
}


use leivestein distance to compare strings (download mySQL data?)
let reference = "Hello World"
assert(reference.levenshtein("Helo Wordl") == 3)
assert(reference.levenshtein("") == reference.characters.count)
